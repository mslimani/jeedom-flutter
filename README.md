# Jeedom mobile app 

Project developed with [flutter](https://flutter.io/)

## Jeedom Api

Jeedom provides a Rest API and an Api JSON RPC.

1. [Jeedom API REST](https://jeedom.github.io/core/fr_FR/api_http)
2. [Jeedom API JSON RPC](https://jeedom.github.io/core/fr_FR/jsonrpc_api)

It is the latter that will be implemented because it is better provided in method.
